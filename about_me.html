<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m an ambitious and driven individual with a strong passion for learning, especially when it comes to technology. My background is in Computer Networking, Cisco IOS, Network Security, Active Directory, IT Support, and Networking, and I’m always looking for ways to grow and expand my skill set.</p>
<p>I graduated with a College Diploma (DEC) in Computer Science from Collège LaSalle in Montréal, where I gained a solid foundation in tech and got the chance to work on a variety of academic projects related to network management, infrastructure, and security.</p>
<p>Now, I’m diving deep into Web Development and excited to master this area. I’m committed to learning as much as I can, keeping up with the latest trends, and applying what I know while constantly pushing myself to grow. My goal is to take everything I’ve learned so far and apply it to building a career in web technologies, with a strong focus on problem-solving and continuous improvement.</p>
